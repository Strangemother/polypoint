to gain the _lowest_ point on a spline

Take the demoninator of the tagent derivative and test it against the ground truth. Step the tangent point in the direction relatively towards the tangent plane.

By performing this over a delta we can _slide_ a point along a spline to discover its optimal resting point, relative to a compass direction.

+ The default _down_ is the relative compass direction.
+ Using `examples/tangent-derivative` base
