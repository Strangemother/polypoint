# Deployment App

This application is a pre-cursor to the "trim deployment" tools, to manage deployment of polypoint - and in the future other apps.

This content start with a working deployment (see [docs/readme.md](./docs/readme.md)) and will be refactored to use the trim deployment tools.

It also includes modular "bits" that can be run independently as needed, generally covered in the primary [readme file](./docs/bits/readme.md).
