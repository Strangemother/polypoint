            <p>Did you know - The copyright statement at the base of any website pretty much means nothing. Work is already copyright by nature of existing. <br>
            For example, if it did mean anything - the statement would exist on all copyright things. But it doesn't... <br>
            </p>
            <p>Polypoint is owned by the Poly.ink supercorp. All your writes are ours! </p>
            <p>This website was created using scary polypoint goblins by Uncle Morz. A Contrabultiph from the Constellation of Fernarr. <em>(I think that what he said.)</em></p>
