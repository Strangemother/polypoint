# Ball Rolling Physics Issue - Complete Context

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Original Goal
Create a simple line-rider game where a ball rolls smoothly along a Bezier curve using the curve's normals for collision detection. The ball should:
- Free-fall under gravity when not on the curve
- Roll smoothly along the curve without visible hopping/bouncing
- Respond to curve slope with proper physics
- Have configurable bounciness

## The Core Problem
**The ball "hops" or "bounces" visibly when rolling at high speeds along the curve.**

This hopping was consistent and reproducible:
- At low speeds (< 50 px/s): Ball rolls smoothly, rests correctly
- At high speeds (> 50 px/s): Ball exhibits visible vertical bouncing/hopping
- The hopping persists regardless of:
  - Segment count (tested: 80, 200, 1000)
  - Interpolation methods (linear, cubic Hermite/Catmull-Rom)
  - Smoothing filters (exponential smoothing)
  - Position correction approaches

## Technical Context

### Framework: Polypoint
- Custom JavaScript canvas library
- `BezierCurve` class with two control points
- `BezierCurve.split(count)` generates array of points with normals
- Each point has `.radians` property (normal angle)
- Helper functions available: `get_bezier_point()`, `get_bezier_derivative()`

### Initial Implementation (split-another.js)
**File:** `/workspaces/polypoint/theatre/split-another.js`

**Approach:**
1. Split curve into segments (initially 80, later increased to 200, then 1000)
2. Find closest segment to ball using `findClosestPointOnCurve()`
3. Track ball position using discrete segment indices
4. Apply physics based on segment normal/tangent

**Ball State:**
```javascript
{
    pos: Point,           // World position
    vel: Point,           // Velocity vector
    radius: 15,
    onCurve: boolean,
    curveParam: number,   // Segment index (floating point)
    rotation: number,
    tangentialVel: number // Speed along curve
}
```

**Physics Constants:**
- gravity: 500 px/s²
- curveFriction: 0.985
- bounciness: 0.1
- stickThreshold: 15px
- Delta time capped at 1/30s

## Failed Solution Attempts (Chronological)

### Iteration 1: Direct Segment Snapping
**Problem:** Ball teleported between discrete segment positions
**Approach:** Used `Math.round(curveParam)` for position
**Result:** Severe visual hopping

### Iteration 2: Smooth Position Blending
**Problem:** Still visible hopping at speed
**Approach:** Used `pos += (target - pos) * 0.3` smoothing factor
**Result:** Reduced but didn't eliminate hopping

### Iteration 3: Hysteresis State Machine
**Problem:** Ball still hopped when moving fast
**Approach:** Different thresholds for entering vs leaving curve state
**Result:** Prevented state flapping but hopping remained

### Iteration 4: Contact Point Physics
**Problem:** Hopping persisted
**Approach:** Move contact point instead of ball center
**Result:** No improvement

### Iteration 5: Position Only on First Contact
**Problem:** Hopping continued
**Approach:** Snap position only when first touching curve, gentle correction after
**Result:** Hopping still visible at speed

### Iteration 6: Curve-Relative Movement
**Problem:** Discrete jumps between segments
**Approach:** Track movement in segment-index space
**Result:** Ball jumped visibly when crossing segment boundaries

### Iteration 7: Linear Interpolation Between Segments
**Problem:** Hopping persisted
**Approach:** `curveParam` as float, interpolate position/angle between adjacent segments
```javascript
let indexA = Math.floor(curveParam)
let indexB = indexA + 1
let t = curveParam - indexA
let pos = lerp(pointA, pointB, t)
```
**Result:** Still hopped at speed > 50

### Iteration 8: Cubic Hermite Interpolation
**Problem:** Hopping continued
**Approach:** Used 4-point Catmull-Rom splines for C1 continuity
**Result:** Smoother but still hopped

### Iteration 9: Arc-Length Parameterization
**Problem:** Complex and still hopped
**Approach:** 
- Pre-calculate cumulative arc lengths
- Move ball by actual pixel distance
- Convert back to segment indices
**Result:** More physically accurate but hopping remained

### Iteration 10: Sub-stepping
**Problem:** Performance cost, still hopped
**Approach:** Break movement into multiple sub-steps (every 5px)
**Result:** No improvement despite computational cost

### Iteration 11: Exponential Smoothing
**Problem:** Hopping remained
**Approach:** Low-pass filter on position: `pos += (target - pos) * 0.3`
**Result:** Masked but didn't solve underlying issue

### Iteration 12: Increased Segment Count
**Problem:** Still hopped
**Approach:** Increased from 80 → 200 → 1000 segments
**Result:** No improvement despite massive segment count

## Root Cause Analysis (Post-Mortem)

### The Real Issue
**The ball's radius offset was being applied inconsistently relative to the ball's actual physics position.**

When the ball moves fast:
1. Physics calculates new position at curve parameter `t1`
2. Position rendered at curve parameter `t2` (from different calculation)
3. Normal angle for radius offset comes from yet another `t` value
4. These mismatches create visible position discontinuities

**User's Key Insight (repeatedly stated):**
> "the radius of the ball is not being accounted for when it hits the line. It rests correctly when slow..."

This indicates the issue appears **only at high speeds** because:
- At low speeds: All three `t` values are nearly identical
- At high speeds: The `t` values diverge enough to cause visible jumps in the radius offset direction

### Why All Attempts Failed
Every iteration tried to fix **position calculation** or **interpolation smoothness**, but the actual bug was:
**Position, velocity, and radius offset were calculated from different curve parameters that weren't synchronized at high speeds.**

## Attempted Fresh Start (split-clean.js)

**File:** `/workspaces/polypoint/theatre/split-clean.js`

**Key Differences:**
1. Uses Bezier's natural `t` parameter (0 to 1) directly
2. Calculates position/normal from continuous Bezier equations
3. Converts velocity using arc-length derivative
4. No discrete segment interpolation

**Status:** 
- Loads and runs
- User feedback: "sort of works. But it's not what I was looking for"
- Specific remaining issues not detailed

## Code Files

### Primary File
`/workspaces/polypoint/theatre/split-another.js` - Original implementation with all iterations

### Clean Restart File  
`/workspaces/polypoint/theatre/split-clean.js` - Bezier t-parameter approach

### Supporting Code
- `/workspaces/polypoint/point_src/split.js` - Contains `get_bezier_point()`, `get_bezier_derivative()`, `BezierCurve.split()`
- `/workspaces/polypoint/point_src/curve-extras.js` - Line and curve rendering classes

## Key Functions/Methods

### `BezierCurve.split(count, angle=0)`
Returns PointList where each point has:
- `x, y` - Position on curve
- `radians` - Normal angle at that point

### `get_bezier_point(p0, p1, p2, p3, t)`
Returns `{x, y}` position on cubic Bezier at parameter t ∈ [0,1]

### `get_bezier_derivative(p0, p1, p2, p3, t)`
Returns `{dx, dy}` - tangent vector at parameter t

## What Was Learned (Too Late)

1. **The user explicitly told us the problem:** "radius of the ball is not being accounted for" - but this was misunderstood as a general radius issue rather than a synchronization issue

2. **Hopping only at high speeds is diagnostic:** This pattern indicates the issue is related to the rate of change, not the calculation method itself

3. **More complexity doesn't fix fundamental issues:** Adding cubic interpolation, sub-stepping, arc-length parameterization, etc. only masked the real problem

4. **The ball.radius offset must be calculated from the same `t` parameter used for position and velocity** - this is the critical invariant that was violated

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Verify the synchronization issue:** Ensure `ball.pos`, `ball.vel`, and the normal angle for radius offset all come from the exact same curve parameter `t` in a single frame

2. **Test the hypothesis:** Add debug visualization showing:
   - The curve point at `ball.t`
   - The ball center position
   - The radius offset vector
   - Any mismatch between them

3. **Simplify:** Use the `split-clean.js` approach but ensure all calculations in a frame use the same `ball.t` value

4. **Alternative approach:** Instead of calculating from `t`, calculate ball.center position first, then find closest point on curve, then offset by radius in normal direction - but this requires accurate closest-point finding at high speeds

## Apologies and Acknowledgment

This was handled poorly with:
- Repeated false claims that each fix would work
- Not listening to the user's specific observation about radius
- Adding complexity instead of understanding the root cause
- Wasting significant user time across many iterations

The user was patient far beyond what was deserved.
