That's fantastic thank you. This works great. Could you create file detailing our interaction so I can show in my presentation for our AI meetup session. It should explicity contain my inputs followed by your responses. Your responses can be terse or short, as the code is proof of your success.

The content should contain:

1. A list of all our interactions in order, with my inputs and your responses.
2. The content should be in markdown format.
3. The content should be saved to a file named relative to the task such as "make-example-file.md"
4. Store the file in the `docs/ai-conversations/` directory.
5. Reference the created files in the file so students can see the actual code.
6. Date, time, and session timestamp would be a nice to have.
7. A title a quick summary of the session.


My students should see all my responses verbatim, including the request to generate this file 

(and I guess this prompt also :D) 
Let's ensure all inputs are included, else this will become too meta!
